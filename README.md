Currency-Converter
Iâ€™m excited to share a recent project Iâ€™ve been working onâ€”a fully functional Currency Converter. This tool allows users to quickly and accurately convert between different currencies using live exchange rates.

Tech Stack:

ðŸ”§HTML/CSS: For creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.
ðŸ”§JavaScript: To handle the conversion logic and user interactions.
ðŸ”§Exchange Rate API: Integrated the ExchangeRate-API to fetch real-time currency data, ensuring accurate conversions every time.

Key Features:

âœ¨Convert between a wide range of global currencies.
âœ¨Dynamic dropdowns to select values.
âœ¨Easy-to-use input field with a responsive interface.
âœ¨Added functionality to clear or delete input amounts seamlessly.
âœ¨This project was a great way to hone my front-end development skills
